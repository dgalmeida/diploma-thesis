<h2 id="app">7.2 Picking the Right Concurrency Concepts for Application Logic</h2>

<p>The main focus of <a href="index.html#chapter/5">chapter 5</a> lies on concurrency concepts for application logic programming. 
In order to recommend appropriate concepts, we need to recap the different concurrency requirements that a web application might imply.
On one hand, we might want to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reduce the latency</SPAN> of request handling by parallelizing independent operations of a request. On the other hand, we might want to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">coordinate different pending requests</SPAN> in order to provide notification mechanisms and support server-initiated events. Furthermore, interactive and collaborative applications cannot rely on state that is solely isolated in the storage backend. Instead, some applications require to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">share highly fluctuating and variable state</SPAN> inside the application servers.

<p>
The reduction of latency of a request can mainly be achieved by parallelizing independent operations. For instance, parallel database queries and subdivided computations decrease the overall latency. 
An important property for accelerating requests is the ratio of CPU-bound and I/O-bound operations. Note that access to our platform components represents an I/O-bound operation.
The latency of independent, CPU-bound operations can only be decreased by using more threads on more cores. When additional threads are used for heavy I/O parallelism, we roughly approach the same problem as seen previously for web servers. Using too many threads for I/O-bound operations results in decreasing performance and scalability issues due to context switching overhead and memory consumption.
For thread-based programming models, the notion of futures or promises helps dispatching independent tasks and eventually collecting their results, without the need for complex synchronization. 
Actors can be used for I/O-bound and CPU-bound operations, although the efficiency depends on the underlying implementation.
Event-driven architectures go nicely with primarily I/O-bound tasks, but they are entirely unusable for computationally heavy operations, as long as these operations are not outsourced to external components.       

<P>
Coordinating requests and synchronizing shared application state are related. 
A first distinction is the scope of these operations. Some applications allow to partially isolate some application state and groups of users for interactivity. 
For instance, a browser multiplayer game session with dozens of players represents a conceptual instance with a single shared application state. A similar example is a web-based collaborative software application like a real-time word processor, running editing sessions with several users.
When using session affinity, a running application instance can be transparently mapped to a designated application server. As a result, there is no need to share states between application servers, because each session is bound to a single server (a server can host multiple application sessions, though). In turn, the server can entirely isolate application state for this session and easily coordinate pending requests for notifications. 
In this case, event-driven architectures, actor-based systems and STM are appropriate concepts. The usage of locks should be avoided due to the risk of deadlocks or race conditions. Note that binding specific state to a certain server is contrary to our shared-nothing design of application servers. 

<P>
In other cases, application state is global and cannot be divided into disjoint partitions. For instance, the instant messaging capabilities of a large social web application requires that any user might contact any other user.
This leads to a scenario where state must be either outsourced to a distributed backend component (e.g. a distributed key/value store with pub/sub support such as redis),
or it requires application servers to mutually share global state.
The first variant works with all concurrency concepts. The latter is only applicable when a distributed STM or a distributed actor system is in use. Note however, these two approaches are contrary to our preferred shared-nothing style, as they introduce dependencies between application servers.

<p>
The conventional concept of a thread-based request execution model is still a valid approach when none of the aforementioned concurrency requirements are actually needed. 
In this case, the idea of a simple sequence of operations provides a very intuitive model for developers.
If there is no imperative need to share state inside the application logic, dedicated backend storages should always be preferred. 
When retaining to a thread-based model and shared state inside the application logic is acutally needed, the usage of STM should be favored in order to prevent locking issues.

<P>
The actor model provides a versatile solution for multiple scenarios, but requires the developer to embrace the notions of asynchrony and distribution. 
Some concurrency frameworks such as <a href="http://www.akka.io/">akka</a> complement the actor model with other concepts such as STM and additional fault tolerance.
This represents a strong foundation for distributed application architectures and should be considered when large scale is intended since the very beginning. 

<P>
If the application logic of a web application primarily integrates the services provided by other platform components and does not require computationally expensive operations, single-threaded event-driven architectures are a good foundation. When used in a shared-nothing style, a sustaining scale-out can be accomplished by constantly adding new instances.

<P>
The actor model and single-threaded event-driven architecture share several principles. Both embrace asynchrony, queueing based on messages resp. events, and isolated state--either inside an actor or inside a single-threaded application instance.
In fact, our web architecture combined with either one of these concepts for application logic resembles the original SEDA architecture&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="0_bibliography.html#Welsh2001">Wel01</A>] to a great extent.
Unlike SEDA, which describes the internals of a single server, we are then using very similar concepts for a distributed architecture.
