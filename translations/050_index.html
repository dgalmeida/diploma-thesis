<h2 id="05">5. Concurrency Concepts for Applications and Business Logic </h2>

<P>
The previous <a href="index.html#chapter/4">chapter 4</a> has dealt with connection concurrency as an issue for web servers.
The challenge is characterized by massively I/O-bound operations, but very limited mutable state.  
In this chapter, we have a look at concurrency from a different angle, 
by focusing on application servers. That is, the component responsible for executing 
the actual business logic of an application, stimulated by incoming requests. 

<P>
The inherent parallelism of requests in a large-scale web architecture is inevitable.
Multiple users access the application at the same time, creating large numbers of independent requests.
In consequence, application servers are components that must cope with a high degree of concurrency.
The main issues we want to address in this chapter are the implications and consequences of different 
concurrency paradigms when used for business logic of application servers. 
This not just includes the impact of handling state in concurrent applications, 
but also the simplicity and accessibility of the particular paradigms for developers.

<P>
Moreover, we are not focusing on specific application server implementations or web application frameworks.
Instead, we have a more general showdown with concurrency and paradigms for concurrent programming. 
The reflections are applicable for distributed and concurrent programming in general.
Eventually, we are in search of an appropriate programming abstraction for the inherent concurrency of an  application that allows us to develop scalable and performant applications, but tames the trouble
of concurrency at the same time.
