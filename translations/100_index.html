<h2 id="conc">10. Conclusion</h2>

<P>
We claim that concurrency is crucial for scalability, which in turn is inherently critical for large-scale architectures.
The growing prevalence of web-based applications thus requires both scalable architectures and appropriate
concepts for concurrent programming. 
Although web-based applications have always faced inherent parallelism, the concurrency implications 
for architectures and implementations are gradually changing.</p>

<P>
The scalability of connection handling is not limited to increasing numbers of connections. 
For web real-time applications, web architectures are frequently confronted with very strict latency requirements.
Interaction and notification mechanisms also demand the ability to handle huge numbers of mostly idle connections, in order to support server-side message pushing over HTTP. 
Also, mobile web applications have a bearing on connection performance and slow down the throughput of web servers.
Similar requirements emerge for the application logic. Interactive web applications demand communication and coordination between multiple requests inside the business logic. In order to provide low latency responses,
the application logic must utilize hardware resources as efficiently as possible. This yields highly concurrent
execution environments for the business logic of web applications.
Concurrency and scalability also challenge the persistence layer of a web architecture. 
The persistence layer must not only scale to very large data volumes, it must also handle
increasingly concurrent read and write operations from the application layer.
Large-scale web applications make the usage of distributed database systems inevitable. 
However, distributed database systems further increase the degree of complexity.</p>  

<P>
This thesis focused on devising an architectural model for scalable web architectures and then providing separate concurrency analyses of three main components: web servers, application servers and storage backends. 
Horizontal scalability and high availability have been the main requirements for the architectural design.  
We rejected a monolithic architecture due to complexity and scalability issues and campaigned for a structured, loosely coupled approach. 
Hence, the architecture is separated into functionally distinct components. Each of the components can be scaled separately and independently of other components.
The components include load balancers, reverse caches, web servers, application servers, caching services, storage
backends, background worker services, and an integration component for external services. 
For the most part, components are coupled using a message-based middleware.</p>

<P>
We then provided a more detailed analysis of the concurrency internals for web servers, application servers and storage backends. We determined that massive I/O parallelism is the main challenge for web servers. We validated thread-based, event-driven and combined architectures for highly concurrent web servers. Next, we called attention to the duality argument of threads and events. 
We surmounted the general threads vs. events discussion and outlined the benefits of cooperative multithreading
and asynchronous/non-blocking I/O operations for programming highly concurrent I/O-bound applications.</p>

<P>
For the implementation of concurrent application logic, we assessed several programming concepts for concurrency from a generic viewpoint.  
The most common form of concurrent programming, based on threads, locks and shared state, is 
difficult and error-prone due to various reasons. Its usage should be limited to components where it is essential and inevitable. This includes low-level architecture components and the foundations for high-level concurrency  libraries. 
For the actual application logic, higher concurrency abstractions are more advisable.
Software transactional memory isolates operations on shared states similar to database systems. 
Hence, it allows lock-free programming and mitigates many problems of traditional multithreading.
The actor model represents an entirely different approach that isolates the mutability of state. 
Actors are separate, single-threaded entities that communicate via immutable, asynchronous and guaranteed messaging. They encapsulate state and provide a programming model that embraces message-based distributed computing. Single-threaded event-driven application components are similar to actors--although they don't share the same architectural mind-set. Lesser known approaches include synchronous message passing and dataflow concepts.</p>

<P>
Storage backends are mainly challenged by the CAP theorem. It disallows guaranteeing consistency and availability at the same time, when partitions must be tolerated at the same time. As a result, applications can either adhere to the conventional ACID properties, but must accept temporary unavailabilities--or they choose eventual consistency and make the application logic resilient to partially stale data.
We illustrated that distributed database systems are based on relational or non-relational concepts and incorporate mechanisms from the database community and the distributed systems community.</p>

<P>
We examined the relations between concurrency, scalability and distributed systems in general and outlined the underlying coherencies. 
We also provided some food for thought--for instance, which upcoming trends might influence future web architectures, and how distributed and concurrent programming can be prospectively handled.</p>

<P>
Unfortunately, there is neither a silver bullet for the design of scalable architectures, nor for concurrent programming. 
We have extensively described the more popular approaches. We also compiled a list of recommendations for the design of concurrent and scalable web architectures of the near future. 
However, concurrency and scalability still remain taxing challenges for distributed systems in general and raise interesting research questions.</p>
