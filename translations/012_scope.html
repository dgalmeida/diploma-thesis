<P>
Concurrency is an essential part of network services, and it is of outstanding
importance for scalable web architectures. Thus we will have a detailed look on
concurrency in three distinct areas of web architectures--connection
handling, application logic and backend persistence. For each stage, we will
discuss its main challenges and issues and explain existing approaches to 
tackle concurrency. We will then compare and assess the different solutions,
while illustrating their advantages and disadvantages.

<P>
By dedicating our analysis to concurrent programming for scalable
web architectures and their applications, to some extent we will also have a look at general
concurrency techniques. However, topics such as parallel
programming, parallel algorithms and high performance computing are out of
scope for this review. We will also focus on pragmatic concurrency approaches instead of 
theoretical concurrency models. In a later chapter, we will dare to take a glance 
at possible concurrency concepts in future programming languages.

<P>
Furthermore, we will solely consider scalability in regard to concurrency, not
taking into account other design and architectural decisions in detail.
