<h2 id="pers">7.3 Choosing a Storage Backend</h2>


<p>We have considered several types of distributed database systems that can be used as storage backend for large-scale web applications in <a href="index.html#chapter/6">chapter 6</a>. 
Assuming that a single database instance does not fit our requirements, due to missing
opportunities to scale out and to provide high availability, we need to choose a proper distributed
database system for our applications. 
We have seen the trade-off between strong consistency and eventual consistency.
The hype around non-relational database systems has led to a myriad of different database systems to choose from. 
In practice, the quest for the right system is often distorted by general arguments between the SQL camp and NoSQL camp by this time.  
The following guideline provides suggestions on how to choose the appropriate system. 

<P>
The primary question is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">actual data model</SPAN> imposed by the application. It is essential to focus on the intrinsic data model of the application first, before considering any database-specific models.
It may also help to identify certain groups of data items that represent independent domains in the application.
Additionally, it is helpful to keep in mind future requirements that might change the data model. 
For instance, an agile development style with frequent changes to the data model should be taken into account.  

<P>
Next, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">scalability requirements</SPAN> must be determined. Scaling out a blog application using additional database 
instances is a different undertaking than growing a large e-commerce site that already starts with multiple data centers.
Also the dimensions of scale should be anticipated. Will the application be challenged by vastly parallel access to the persistence layer, or is it the fast-growing amount of data to store? 
The ratio of read and write operations can be important as well as the impact of search operations. 

<P>
The third of these preliminary considerations aims at <SPAN  CLASS="textit">consistency requirements</SPAN> of the application.
It is obvious that strong consistency is generally preferred by all parties involved. However, a review 
of the impact of stale data in different manifestations may help to define parts of the data model that can aligned with relaxed consistency requirements. 

<p>
Due to their maturity, their features and our experiential basis, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">relation database systems</SPAN> 
still represent a strong foundation for the persistence layer of web applications. 
This is especially true, when the applications require strong consistency guarantees, transactional
behaviors and high performance for transaction processing. Also, the expressiveness of SQL as a query
language is conclusive and queries can be executed ad-hoc at any time.
In order to tackle scalability for relational database systems, it is important to keep in mind 
functional and data partitioning strategies from the start. Sharding an unprepared relational database
is extremely hard. But when denormalization and partitioning are designed into the data model, 
the opportunities for a sustainable scale-out are vastly increased.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Document stores</SPAN> are interesting as they provide a very flexible data modeling, that combines
structured data but does not rely on schema definitions. It allows the rapid evolving of data models and
fits very well to an agile development approach.   
The mapping of structured key-value pairs (i.e. documents) to domain objects is also very natural 
for many web applications, especially applications that are built around social objects.
If database operations primarily involve create/read/update/delete operations, and more complex queries
can be defined already in the development phase, document stores represent a good fit.    
The document-oriented data formats like JSON or XML are friendly for web developers. 
Moreover, many document stores allow storing binary files such as images inside their document model, which can also be useful for web applications. 
Due to the underlying organization of documents as key/value tuples, document stores can easily scale 
horizontally by sharding the key space. 

<P>
In general, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">key/value stores</SPAN> are the first choice when the data model can be expressed by key/value tuples with arbitrary values and no complex queries are required. Key/value stores not just allow easy scaling, they are also a good fit when many concurrent read and write operations are expected.   
Some key/value stores use a volatile in-memory storage, hence they provide unmatched performance. 
These systems represent interesting caching solutions, sometimes complemented with publish/subscribe capabilities.  
Other durable systems provide a tunable consistency based on quorum setups.
Key/value stores that adopt eventual consistency often accept write operations at any time, even in the face
of network partitions. 
As the data model resembles distributed hash tables, scaling out is generally a very easy task.   

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Graph databases</SPAN> are a rather specific storage type, but unrivaled when it comes to graph applications.
Lately, social network applications and location-based services have rediscovered 
the strengths of graph databases for operations on social graphs or proximity searches.
Graph databases often provide transaction support and ACID compliancy.
When scaling out, the partitioning of graphs represents a non-trivial problem. 
However, the data model of such applications often tends to be less data-heavy. 
Existing systems also claim to handle several billion nodes, relationships and properties on a single instance using commodity hardware.   

<P>
When designing very large architectures that involve multiple data centers, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">wide column stores</SPAN>
become the systems of choice. They support data models with wide tables and extremely sparse columns. 
Wide column stores perform well on massive bulk write operations and on complex aggregating queries.
In essence, they represent a good tool for data warehousing and analytical processing, but they are
less adequate for transaction processing.
Existing systems come in different flavors, either favoring strong or eventual consistency. 
Wide column stores are designed for easy scaling and provide sharding capabilities.

<p>
When designing large-scale web applications, also polyglot persistence should be considered. If no database type fits all needs, different domains of the data models may be separated, effectively using different database systems. 

<P>
As an illustration, an e-commerce site has very different requirements.
The stock of products is an indispensable asset and customers expect consistent information on product availabilities (=> relational database system).
Customer data rarely change and previous orders do not change at all. Both types belong to a data warehouse storage, mainly for analytics (=> wide column store).  
Tracked user actions in order to calculate recommendations can be stored asynchronously into a data warehouse for decoupled analytical processing at a later time (=> wide column store). 
The implications for the content of a shopping cart is very different. 
Customers expect every action to succeed, no matter if a node in the data center fails.  
So eventual consistency is required in order to accept every single write  (e.g. add to chart) operation (=> wide column store). 
Of course, the e-commerce application must then deal with the consequences of conflicting operations,
by merging different versions of a chart.    
For product ratings and comments, consistency can also be relaxed (=> document store). 
Very similar considerations are advisable for most other large-scale web applications.
