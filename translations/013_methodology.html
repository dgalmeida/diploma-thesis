<P>
This thesis brings together different resources on concurrency, web
architectures and  scalable network infrastructures. The primary sources are research publications 
and technical analyses. Additionally, documentations of design
patterns, systems, programming languages and frameworks are considered. 

<P>
As the main contribution of this thesis, we provide a comprehensive survey on the 
myriads of different concepts and techniques of concurrency inside web
architectures. We compare and evaluate approaches based on their characteristic features and
impacts, and provide guidelines for choosing the right approach for a given
problem.
