<P>
So far, we have considered different approaches towards concurrency as part of scalable architectures, including
highly concurrent connection handling, concurrent application logic and distributed storage backends.
We have become acquainted with several different concepts that address concurrency and scalability challenges and are increasingly established in the industry.
Interestingly, many of these concepts are rather old, but have been rediscovered and revamped as existing
solutions for arising problems in the era of cloud computing, big data and multi-cores.

In this chapter, we will go one step further and dare to take a glance at the future of web architechtures and concurrent programming in distributed systems. 
This overview is primarily based on ongoing efforts in the research community and emerging industry trends.
