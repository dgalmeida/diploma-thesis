<h2 id="motivation">1.4 Road Map </h2>

<P>
We start off with a brief introduction to the WWW, concurrency and
scalability in <a href="index.html#chapter/2">chapter 2</a>. 
We then focus on web architectures in <a href="index.html#chapter/3">chapter 3</a> and elaborate a general 
architectural model for scalable web architectures based on existing
systems. Next, we have an isolated look at different stages of this
model and get to know their relevant concurrency challenges and available
approaches to adopt. This includes web servers in <a href="index.html#chapter/4">chapter 4</a>, 
applications and business logic in <a href="index.html#chapter/5">chapter 5</a> and 
backend storages in <a href="index.html#chapter/6">chapter 6</a>.  
In <a href="index.html#chapter/7">chapter 7</a>, we provide a guideline for choosing a decent approach or concept for different scenarios.
Next, we discuss the results of our considerations as part of <a href="index.html#chapter/8">chapter 8</a> and take a look at the
essence of concurrency and scalability in distributed systems.
We finally dare an outlook on the near future of web architectures and how it will be affected by new web technologies and programming concepts in <a href="index.html#chapter/9">chapter 9</a>.
The conclusion in <a href="index.html#chapter/10">chapter 10</a> sums up our survey on concurrency in web architectures.
